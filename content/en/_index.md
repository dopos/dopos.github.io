        Expressive [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/), great [docker](https://www.docker.com/) and awesome open source applications hosted on [github](https://github.com/). It gives ability to get CI/CD systems very easily.
        In the simplest case, it is enough to have `docker-compose.yml` and run `docker-compose up` command. But sometimes reality is slightly harder.
        Dopos helps to go all the way from repository to running stack of docker containers with help of [make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) and our project <a href="/dcape">DCAPE</a>.
