        Expressive [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/), great [docker]() and awesome open source applications hosted on [github]() gives ability to get CI/CD systems very easy.
        In the simplest case, it is enough to have `docker-compose.yml` and run `docker-compose up` command. But sometimes reality is slightly harder.
        Dopos helps to go all the way from idea to running stack of docker containers with help of [make]() and our project <a href="/dcape">DCAPE</a>.
